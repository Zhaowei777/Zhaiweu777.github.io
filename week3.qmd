# week 3 - corrections

## Overview

1.1.1 Overview
This week's journey into remote sensing unveils the potential for image correction and enhancement. While corrections aim to rectify sensor, atmospheric, or terrain-induced distortions, our focus will shift towards enhancement techniques, specifically Ratio, Texture, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to enrich remote sensing imagery interpretation.

1.1.2 Ratio Enhancement: The NDVI Technique
Ratio enhancements exploit varying spectral signatures across materials to accentuate particular elements. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) leverages red and near-infrared bands, highlighting healthy vegetation's unique reflective properties. Below is a formula representation and its application on Cape Town's Landsat imagery from 2022, revealing vegetation health:

By setting a threshold NDVI value above 0.15, the visualization emphasizes vibrant farmland north of Cape Town, with urban and aquatic regions depicted in white. Interestingly, indigenous vegetation areas like Cape Point peninsula don't prominently feature in NDVI outputs, possibly due to seasonal variations affecting the indigenous versus agricultural vegetation contrast:

1.1.3 Texture Analysis
Texture analysis measures pixel similarity within a spatial context, offering insights into landscape homogeneity. Utilizing a grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), this technique assesses homogeneity across pixels, distinguishing highly uniform areas from those with significant variance. The resultant texture map for Cape Town illustrates the differentiation between homogenous regions (such as oceans and agricultural lands) and areas of stark contrast (e.g., the coastal interface):

1.1.4 Principal Component Analysis 
PCA serves as a dimensionality reduction tool, simplifying complex, multi-band spectral data into principal components that capture the majority of data variance.
