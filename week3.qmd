## Overview

![Week3 Mind Map](image/week3Image.png)

Starting from this week, I will use the form of mind map to summarize this week's knowledge, an intuitive and focused way.

[OK! Now Let's explore some applications!]{style="color:blue;"}

## Applications

Vegetation Indices (VIs) have evolved over the past four decades in the field of remote sensing, becoming essential tools for assessing vegetation. Since the launch of the first Earth Resource Satellite in 1972, scientists have been attempting to establish approximate relationships between spectral responses and vegetation cover(Eastman et al., 2013).

Over the past two decades, more than forty vegetation indices have been researched and developed, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI).

While VIs provide a convenient and quick tool for vegetation monitoring, their application is influenced and constrained by factors such as weather conditions, observational conditions of remote sensors, soil moisture, etc. Moreover, in different environmental conditions, the analysis of vegetation indices becomes more complex(Xue & Su, 2017). This also implies that future research should target the vegetation-soil-atmosphere system as a whole, taking into consideration the characteristics of remote sensors and electromagnetic radiation.

Additionally, the effectiveness of using VIs for vegetation monitoring greatly depends on the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of remote sensing data. Lower resolutions may not accurately capture small-scale vegetation changes, while acquiring high-resolution data can be costly.

Looking forward to future developments, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the repeated mention of smart cities, smart agriculture becomes a crucial part of smart cities, where Vegetation Indices can be fully utilized. Integrating multi-temporal satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observational data with field soil, vegetation, and yield observations, soil type maps, elevation maps, historical parcel and crop information, and meteorological data could provide data support for agricultural management, enabling more precise crop management. Furthermore, the introduction of concepts like "Task Map 2.0" and "AgroGIS," which automatically generate precise crop management instructions, further promotes the practice of ‘Smart Agriculture’(Nicholas et al., 2022).

## Reflection

Due to my interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), in my past explorations I have seen the great potential of IoT and its application to smart agriculture. Through this week's study, I have realised that remote sensing can also contribute immensely to smart agriculture, and that this interdisciplinary development is an inevitable trend in the development of our present society, and an important way in which we can contribute to the achievement of the goals of the United Nations.

There is a remarkable example in practical applications: In Wageningen, Nederland, The National Smart Farming Pilot Project (NPPL) has been established by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and Wageningen Plant Research ProAgrica, it aims to combine remote sensing technology and Internet of Things technology to create more productive and intelligent agricultural systems(Wageningen University & Research, 2017).
