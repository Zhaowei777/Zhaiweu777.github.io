# About Me {.unnumbered}

## Acknowledgement

I extend my sincerest thanks to Dr. Maclachlan and Dr. Ballinger for their invaluable guidance, to our PGTAs for their unwavering support, and to my fellow group members of the FloraDemeter Visionaries. 

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Zhaowei, a student deeply passionate about art, computer science, and urban science, and an enthusiast of music and photography. I am currently pursuing a master's degree at The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London. Throughout my early education, I focused on honing my creative design and oil painting skills, dreaming of becoming an artist. I completed my Bachelor of Design at the University of Melbourne, where I also took foundational courses in artificial intelligence. During that time, I developed a basic understanding of urban planning, spatial engineering, and architecture, and realized the importance of computer science in everyday life and academia.

These are some works from my personal photography studio:

My current research interests lie in the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities. I believe that improving people's quality of life through data science and computer science is a fascinating endeavor. Remote sensing technology significantly advances urban planning by offering detailed insights into land use and environmental changes, enabling sustainable development and improved resilience against environmental challenges. 

In daily life, there have always been 'two' mes: one who loves art and the other who loves computer science. This diary was jointly completed by these 'two' mes. [The part of me that loves art (in blue font)]{style="color:blue;"} converses with the part that loves computer science (in black font) during the writing of this diary. The dialogue between these two sides of me together completes this diary.

This website serves as my learning diary for the CASA0027 course, reflecting on and deepening my understanding of remote sensing knowledge. I hope everyone enjoys it and I welcome any criticism or praise!

"We can really say that we have achieved a level of remote sensing and Earth observation that we have never had before. We're in the golden age right now with these satellites."
