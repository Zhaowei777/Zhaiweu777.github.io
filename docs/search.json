    "text": "1.1 Overview\nWeek1, let’s start with a ‘simple’ question: What is remote sensing?\nNASA defined Remote sensing as an acquisition of information from a distance. In my understanding, this tech involves acquiring data about entities or regions without direct physical interaction. Typically, it is achieved by detecting and documenting energy that is either reflected or emitted, followed by the processing, analysis, and utilization of this data.\nIts implementation is through sensors mounted on various platforms: like Satellites, Airplanes (for aerial imagery), Drones and Smartphones. There are over 150 satellites in orbit equipped with sensors for remote sensing.\nRemote sensing is a tool, a way to observe the Earth, one of the sources of information. Remote sensing is included in the steps of data acquisition, data processing and data analysis. It acquires data about objects or areas from a distance. These recording techniques and image construction instruments are composed by sensors attached to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), drones, airplanes, or satellites; these sensors can be passive or active sensors such as sonar, radar or lidar attached to aircrafts or ships. Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or spacecraft. Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers “sense” things about the Earth.\nSome examples are: • Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth’s surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground. • Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean. • Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.\nWhat types of remote sensing are there?\nThere are manly two types of sensor:\nActive sensors are equipped with their own illumination source, actively emitting electromagnetic waves and then measuring the backscatter that returns to the sensor. Examples like: Radar and LiDAR. Their application includes generating precise digital elevation models through the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), monitoring rainforest depletion via LiDAR technology, and supporting security measures with its effectiveness in marine and Arctic surveillance.\nConversely, passive sensors don’t emit anything. They rely on natural light, detecting reflected energy(in electromagnetic waves) from the sun. Examples like: Landsat series and IRS-series. The Landsat series, active for over four decades, stands as the most enduring Earth observation initiative in passive remote sensing. It provides critical insights into Earth’s climate, ecosystems, and land use changes, serving as a historical marker for environmental transformation.\n1.1.2 Types of Remote Sensors Remote sensing technology employs two primary types of sensors: Active and Passive. Passive sensors depend on sunlight reflected off the Earth’s surface, which can be affected by clouds or atmospheric conditions. Conversely, active sensors emit their own signals toward the Earth and capture the reflected data, enabling their operation in darkness and through obstructions like clouds. The diagram below exemplifies these differences:\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic Signatures Passive sensors capture reflected radiation from Earth, with different materials reflecting various radiation types across the electromagnetic spectrum. Each sensor is tuned to specific wavelengths, offering unique insights. The following illustration delineates the electromagnetic spectrum and the operational range of different sensors:\nCertain radiation types penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere, notable for remote sensing applications.\n1.1.4 Data Resolutions Four critical resolutions define remote sensing data: - Spectral: Refers to the sensor’s ability to capture different wavelength bands. - Spatial: Describes the pixel size, affecting detail level. - Temporal: Indicates how often a sensor revisits a specific location. - Radiometric: Denotes the range of detected reflectance values.\n1.1.5 Sentinel 2 Sentinel 2 offers advantages over Landsat 8, including higher resolution across most bands, shorter revisit times, and additional spectral bands. An intriguing use case involved detecting a gas leak in the Nord Stream pipeline following seismic activities, as illustrated in the animation below:\nFurthermore, Sentinel-2’s resolution aids in monitoring sea ice and glacier dynamics, offering insights into environmental changes.\n1.1.6 Landsat With a history spanning over five decades, Landsat’s contributions to Earth observation are substantial. An early success was the identification of Landsat Island, demonstrating its exploration capabilities.\nCurrent Landsat missions continue to provide valuable data. My preliminary analysis involved creating a true-color composite of Cape Town and examining spectral signatures via R, illustrating diverse applications of Landsat data.\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2",

    "text": "3.1 Overview\n1.1.1 Overview This week’s journey into remote sensing unveils the potential for image correction and enhancement. While corrections aim to rectify sensor, atmospheric, or terrain-induced distortions, our focus will shift towards enhancement techniques, specifically Ratio, Texture, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to enrich remote sensing imagery interpretation.\n1.1.2 Ratio Enhancement: The NDVI Technique Ratio enhancements exploit varying spectral signatures across materials to accentuate particular elements. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) leverages red and near-infrared bands, highlighting healthy vegetation’s unique reflective properties. Below is a formula representation and its application on Cape Town’s Landsat imagery from 2022, revealing vegetation health:\nBy setting a threshold NDVI value above 0.15, the visualization emphasizes vibrant farmland north of Cape Town, with urban and aquatic regions depicted in white. Interestingly, indigenous vegetation areas like Cape Point peninsula don’t prominently feature in NDVI outputs, possibly due to seasonal variations affecting the indigenous versus agricultural vegetation contrast:\n1.1.3 Texture Analysis Texture analysis measures pixel similarity within a spatial context, offering insights into landscape homogeneity. Utilizing a grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), this technique assesses homogeneity across pixels, distinguishing highly uniform areas from those with significant variance. The resultant texture map for Cape Town illustrates the differentiation between homogenous regions (such as oceans and agricultural lands) and areas of stark contrast (e.g., the coastal interface):\n1.1.4 Principal Component Analysis PCA serves as a dimensionality reduction tool, simplifying complex, multi-band spectral data into principal components that capture the majority of data variance.",
